# Comprehensive Pneumonia Content

## Definition
Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, can cause pneumonia.

## Causes
Pneumonia can be caused by:
- **Bacteria**: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause
- **Viruses**: Including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2
- **Fungi**: More common in people with weakened immune systems
- **Mycoplasma**: A type of bacteria that causes "walking pneumonia"

## Symptoms
Common symptoms include:
- Cough that may produce phlegm
- Fever, sweating, and shaking chills
- Shortness of breath
- Chest pain that worsens when breathing or coughing
- Fatigue and muscle aches
- Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea (more common in children)

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis typically involves:
- Physical examination (listening to lungs with stethoscope)
- Chest X-ray to confirm infection and determine extent
- Blood tests to identify the organism causing infection
- Sputum culture to analyze phlegm
- Pulse oximetry to measure oxygen levels

## Treatment Options
Treatment depends on the type and severity:
- **Bacterial pneumonia**: Antibiotics (amoxicillin, azithromycin, levofloxacin)
- **Viral pneumonia**: Antiviral medications, rest, and symptom management
- **Fungal pneumonia**: Antifungal medications
- **Severe cases**: Hospitalization, oxygen therapy, IV antibiotics

## Prevention
- Vaccination (pneumococcal and influenza vaccines)
- Good hygiene (handwashing, covering coughs)
- Not smoking
- Managing chronic conditions
- Healthy lifestyle (adequate sleep, nutrition, exercise)

## Risk Groups
- Children under 5 years
- Adults 65 and older
- People with weakened immune systems
- People with chronic medical conditions (heart disease, diabetes, COPD)
- Smokers

## Epidemiology
- Pneumonia is a leading cause of death worldwide, especially in children under 5
- In the United States, pneumonia causes over 50,000 deaths annually
- Most cases are preventable with vaccination and proper treatment
- Incidence increases during flu season
